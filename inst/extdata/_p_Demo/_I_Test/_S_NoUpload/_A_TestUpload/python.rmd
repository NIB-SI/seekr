## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
You can use python scripts as well:
```{python}
a, b = 0, 1
while a < 1000:
  print(a, end=',')
  a, b = b, a+b
```

## How python values are visible in R?

Look at [this blog](https://notast.netlify.app/post/r-you-ready-for-python-gentle-introduction-to-reticulate-package/).

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
Plist= [11,22,33,44,55,66]

print(Plist)
```

```{r}
py_eval("Plist")
py$Plist
```



```{python}

def Psq_fun (x):
  value= x*x 
  return(value)
  
print(Psq_fun(9))
```
